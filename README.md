    <h1>Design patterns</h1>
    <p>This repository is a collection of practice/examples of Design Patterns.</p>
    <p>Some of them are very simple, but remember, thats the idea!! We are learning here!!</p>
    <p>One of the challenges of learning Design Patterns is that the examples out there in
    the wild are too complex or confusing, because they are intended for seasoned developers,
  not for begginers. So I hope this helps somebody ;) </p>
